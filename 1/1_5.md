# Learning with gradient descent

Now that we have a design for our neural network, how can it learn to recognize digits? The first thing we'll need is a data set to learn from - a so-called 
training data set. We'll use the [MNIST data set](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which contains tens of thousands of scanned images of handwritten digits, 
together with their correct classifications. MNIST's name comes from the fact that it is a modified subset of two data sets collected by 
[NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology), 
the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology. Here's a few images from MNIST:

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/digits_separate.png" width="400"/>
</p>

As you can see, these digits are, in fact, the same as those shown at the beginning of this chapter as a challenge to recognize. Of course, when testing our 
network we'll ask it to recognize images which aren't in the training set!
The MNIST data comes in two parts. The first part contains 60,000 images to be used as training data. These images are scanned handwriting samples from 250 
people, half of whom were US Census Bureau employees, and half of whom were high school students. The images are greyscale and 28 by 28 pixels in size. The second 
part of the MNIST data set is 10,000 images to be used as test data. Again, these are 28 by 28 greyscale images. We'll use the test data to evaluate how well our 
neural network has learned to recognize digits. To make this a good test of performance, the test data was taken from a different set of 250 people than the 
original training data (albeit still a group split between Census Bureau employees and high school students). This helps give us confidence that our system can 
recognize digits from people whose writing it didn't see during training.

We'll use the notation x to denote a training input. It'll be convenient to regard each training input x as a 28×28=784-dimensional vector. Each entry in the 
vector represents the grey value for a single pixel in the image. We'll denote the corresponding desired output by y=y(x), where y is a 10-dimensional vector. For 
example, if a particular training image, x, depicts a 6, then y(x)=(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0)<sup>T</sup> is the desired output from the network. Note that T here is the 
transpose operation, turning a row vector into an ordinary (column) vector.

What we'd like is an algorithm which lets us find weights and biases so that the output from the network approximates y(x) for all training inputs x. To quantify 
how well we're achieving this goal we define a **cost function**<sup>[*](#fn1)</sup>

<a name="fn1">*</a>Sometimes referred to as a loss or objective function. We use the term cost function throughout this book, but you should note the
other terminology, since it's often used in research papers and other discussions of neural networks. </a>
  
Here, w denotes the collection of all weights in the network, b all the biases, n is the total number of training inputs, a is the vector of outputs from the 
network when x is input, and the sum is over all training inputs, x. Of course, the output a depends on x, w and b, but to keep the notation simple I haven't 
explicitly indicated this dependence. The notation ∥v∥ just denotes the usual length function for a vector v. We'll call C the quadratic cost function; it's also 
sometimes known as the mean squared error or just MSE. Inspecting the form of the quadratic cost function, we see that C(w,b) is non-negative, since every term in 
the sum is non-negative. Furthermore, the cost C(w,b) becomes small, i.e., C(w,b)≈0, precisely when y(x) is approximately equal to the output, a, for all training 
inputs, x. So our training algorithm has done a good job if it can find weights and biases so that C(w,b)≈0. By contrast, it's not doing so well when C(w,b) is 
large - that would mean that y(x) is not close to the output a for a large number of inputs. So the aim of our training algorithm will be to minimize the cost 
C(w,b) as a function of the weights and biases. In other words, we want to find a set of weights and biases which make the cost as small as possible. We'll do 
that using an algorithm known as _gradient descent_.

Why introduce the quadratic cost? After all, aren't we primarily interested in the number of images correctly classified by the network? Why not try to maximize 
that number directly, rather than minimizing a proxy measure like the quadratic cost? The problem with that is that the number of images correctly classified is 
not a smooth function of the weights and biases in the network. For the most part, making small changes to the weights and biases won't cause any change at all in 
the number of training images classified correctly. That makes it difficult to figure out how to change the weights and biases to get improved performance. If we 
instead use a smooth cost function like the quadratic cost it turns out to be easy to figure out how to make small changes in the weights and biases so as to get 
an improvement in the cost. That's why we focus first on minimizing the quadratic cost, and only after that will we examine the classification accuracy.

Even given that we want to use a smooth cost function, you may still wonder why we choose the quadratic function used in [Equation (6)](#6). Isn't this a rather 
ad hoc choice 
Perhaps if we chose a different cost function we'd get a totally different set of minimizing weights and biases? This is a valid concern, and later we'll revisit 
the cost function, and make some modifications. However, the quadratic cost function of [Equation (6)](#6) works perfectly well for understanding the basics of 
learning in neural networks, so we'll stick with it for now.

Recapping, our goal in training a neural network is to find weights and biases which minimize the quadratic cost function C(w,b). This is a well-posed problem, 
but it's got a lot of distracting structure as currently posed - the interpretation of w and b as weights and biases, the σ function lurking in the background, 
the choice of network architecture, MNIST, and so on. It turns out that we can understand a tremendous amount by ignoring most of that structure, and just 
concentrating on the minimization aspect. So for now we're going to forget all about the specific form of the cost function, the connection to neural networks, 
and so on. Instead, we're going to imagine that we've simply been given a function of many variables and we want to minimize that function. We're going to develop 
a technique called _gradient descent_ which can be used to solve such minimization problems. Then we'll come back to the specific function we want to minimize for neural networks.

Okay, let's suppose we're trying to minimize some function, C(v). This could be any real-valued function of many variables, v=v1,v2,…. Note that I've replaced the 
w and b notation by v to emphasize that this could be any function - we're not specifically thinking in the neural networks context any more. To minimize C(v) it 
helps to imagine C as a function of just two variables, which we'll call v1 and v2:

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/valley.png" width="400"/>
</p>
 
What we'd like is to find where C achieves its global minimum. Now, of course, for the function plotted above, we can eyeball the graph and find the minimum. In 
that sense, I've perhaps shown slightly too simple a function! A general function, C, may be a complicated function of many variables, and it won't usually be 
possible to just eyeball the graph to find the minimum.

One way of attacking the problem is to use calculus to try to find the minimum analytically. We could compute derivatives and then try using them to find places 
where C is an extremum. With some luck that might work when C is a function of just one or a few variables. But it'll turn into a nightmare when we have many more 
variables. And for neural networks we'll often want far more variables - the biggest neural networks have cost functions which depend on billions of weights and 
biases in an extremely complicated way. Using calculus to minimize that just won't work!

(After asserting that we'll gain insight by imagining C as a function of just two variables, I've turned around twice in two paragraphs and said, "hey, but what 
if it's a function of many more than two variables?" Sorry about that. Please believe me when I say that it really does help to imagine C as a function of two 
variables. It just happens that sometimes that picture breaks down, and the last two paragraphs were dealing with such breakdowns. Good thinking about mathematics 
often involves juggling multiple intuitive pictures, learning when it's appropriate to use each picture, and when it's not.)

Okay, so calculus doesn't work. Fortunately, there is a beautiful analogy which suggests an algorithm which works pretty well. We start by thinking of our 
function as a kind of a valley. If you squint just a little at the plot above, that shouldn't be too hard. And we imagine a ball rolling down the slope of the 
valley. Our everyday experience tells us that the ball will eventually roll to the bottom of the valley. Perhaps we can use this idea as a way to find a minimum 
for the function? We'd randomly choose a starting point for an (imaginary) ball, and then simulate the motion of the ball as it rolled down to the bottom of the 
valley. We could do this simulation simply by computing derivatives (and perhaps some second derivatives) of C - those derivatives would tell us everything we 
need to know about the local "shape" of the valley, and therefore how our ball should roll.

Based on what I've just written, you might suppose that we'll be trying to write down Newton's equations of motion for the ball, considering the effects of 
friction and gravity, and so on. Actually, we're not going to take the ball-rolling analogy quite that seriously - we're devising an algorithm to minimize C, not 
developing an accurate simulation of the laws of physics! The ball's-eye view is meant to stimulate our imagination, not constrain our thinking. So rather than 
get into all the messy details of physics, let's simply ask ourselves: if we were declared God for a day, and could make up our own laws of physics, dictating to 
the ball how it should roll, what law or laws of motion could we pick that would make it so the ball always rolled to the bottom of the valley?

To make this question more precise, let's think about what happens when we move the ball a small amount Δv<sub>1</sub> in the v1 direction, and a small amount Δv<sub>2</sub> in the v2 
direction. Calculus tells us that C changes as follows:

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://latex2png.com/pngs/60afb2b669df457c6beec90c9a858234.png" width="400"/>
   <b><a name="7">(7)</a></b>
</p>

We're going to find a way of choosing Δv<sub>1</sub> and Δv<sub>2</sub> so as to make ΔC negative; i.e., we'll choose them so the ball is rolling down into the 
valley. To figure out how to make such a choice it helps to define Δv to be the vector of changes in v, Δv≡( Δv<sub>1</sub>,Δv<sub>2</sub>)<sup>T</sup>,where T is 
again the transpose operation, turning row vectors into column vectors. We'll also define the *gradient* of C to be the vector of partial derivatives, 
(<sup>∂C</sup>&frasl;<sub>∂v<sub>1</sub></sub>,<sup>∂C</sup>&frasl;<sub>∂v<sub>2</sub></sub>)<sup>T</sup>. We denote the gradient vector by ∇C, i.e.:

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://latex2png.com/pngs/3c55f1be0e469da44f083733a3d88dfd.png" width="400"/>
   <b><a name="8">(8)</a></b>
</p>

In a moment we'll rewrite the change ΔC in terms of Δv and the gradient, ∇C. Before getting to that, though, I want to clarify something that sometimes gets 
people hung up on the gradient. When meeting the ∇C notation for the first time, people sometimes wonder how they should think about the ∇ symbol. What, exactly, 
does ∇ mean? In fact, it's perfectly fine to think of ∇C as a single mathematical object - the vector defined above - which happens to be written using two 
symbols. In this point of view, ∇ is just a piece of notational flag-waving, telling you "hey, ∇C is a gradient vector". There are more advanced points of view 
where ∇ can be viewed as an independent mathematical entity in its own right (for example, as a differential operator), but we won't need such points of view.

With these definitions, the expression [(7)](#7) for ΔC can be rewritten as

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://latex2png.com/pngs/c608f25680080133556a862db0d6cab7.png" width="400"/>
   <b><a name="9">(9)</a></b>
</p>

This equation helps explain why ∇C is called the gradient vector: ∇C relates changes in v to changes in C, just as we'd expect something called a gradient to do. 
But what's really exciting about the equation is that it lets us see how to choose Δv so as to make ΔC negative. In particular, suppose we choose

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://latex2png.com/pngs/10fd26f3a27ff32f49ed5dc8760e92bc.png" width="400"/>
   <b><a name="10">(10)</a></b>
</p>

where η is a small, positive parameter (known as the learning rate). Then Equation [(9)](#9) tells us that ΔC≈−η∇C⋅∇C=−η∥∇C∥<sup>2</sup> . Because ∥∇C∥2≥0, this 
guarantees that ΔC≤0, i.e., C will always decrease, never increase, if we change v according to the prescription in [(10)](#10). (Within, of course, the limits of 
the approximation in Equation [(9)](#9)). This is exactly the property we wanted! And so we'll take Equation [(10)](#10) to define the "law of motion" for the 
ball in our gradient descent algorithm. That is, we'll use Equation [(10)](#10) to compute a value for Δv, then move the ball's position v by that amount:

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://latex2png.com/pngs/08ab3e5dd0df3b500dbe20b82e089d2a.png" width="400"/>
   <b><a name="11">(11)</a></b>
</p>

Then we'll use this update rule again, to make another move. If we keep doing this, over and over, we'll keep decreasing C until - we hope - we reach a global 
minimum.

Summing up, the way the gradient descent algorithm works is to repeatedly compute the gradient ∇C, and then to move in the *opposite* direction, "falling down" 
the slope of the valley. We can visualize it like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/valley_with_ball.png" width="400"/>
</p>

Notice that with this rule gradient descent doesn't reproduce real physical motion. In real life a ball has momentum, and that momentum may allow it to roll 
across the slope, or even (momentarily) roll uphill. It's only after the effects of friction set in that the ball is guaranteed to roll down into the valley. By 
contrast, our rule for choosing Δv just says "go down, right now". That's still a pretty good rule for finding the minimum!

To make gradient descent work correctly, we need to choose the learning rate η to be small enough that Equation [(9)](#9) is a good approximation. If we don't, we 
might end up with ΔC>0, which obviously would not be good! At the same time, we don't want η to be too small, since that will make the changes Δv tiny, and thus 
the gradient descent algorithm will work very slowly. In practical implementations, η is often varied so that Equation [(9)](#9) remains a good approximation, but 
the algorithm isn't too slow. We'll see later how this works.

I've explained gradient descent when C is a function of just two variables. But, in fact, everything works just as well even when C is a function of many more 
variables. Suppose in particular that C is a function of *m* variables, v1,…,vm. Then the change ΔC in C produced by a small change Δv=(Δv<sub>1</sub>,…,Δv<sub>m</sub>)<sup>T</sup> is

   <b><a name="12">(12)</a></b>
</p>

where the gradient ∇C is the vector

<p align="center">

   <b><a name="13">(13)</a></b>
</p>

Just as for the two variable case, we can choose

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://latex2png.com/pngs/10fd26f3a27ff32f49ed5dc8760e92bc.png" width="400"/>
   <b><a name="14">(14)</a></b>
</p>

and we're guaranteed that our (approximate) expression [(12)](#12) for ΔC will be negative. This gives us a way of following the gradient to a minimum, even when 
C is a function of many variables, by repeatedly applying the update rule

<p align="center">

</p>

You can think of this update rule as defining the gradient descent algorithm. It gives us a way of repeatedly changing the position v in order to find a minimum 
of the function C. The rule doesn't always work - several things can go wrong and prevent gradient descent from finding the global minimum of C, a point we'll 
return to explore in later chapters. But, in practice gradient descent often works extremely well, and in neural networks we'll find that it's a powerful way of 
minimizing the cost function, and so helping the net learn.

Indeed, there's even a sense in which gradient descent is the optimal strategy for searching for a minimum. Let's suppose that we're trying to make a move Δv in 
position so as to decrease C as much as possible. This is equivalent to minimizing ΔC≈∇C⋅Δv. We'll constrain the size of the move so that ∥Δv∥=ϵ for some small 
fixed ϵ>0. In other words, we want a move that is a small step of a fixed size, and we're trying to find the movement direction which decreases C as much as 
possible. It can be proved that the choice of Δv which minimizes ∇C⋅Δv is Δv=−η∇C, where η=ϵ/∥∇C∥ is determined by the size constraint ∥Δv∥=ϵ. So gradient descent 
can be viewed as a way of taking small steps in the direction which does the most to immediately decrease C.

## Exercises

- Prove the assertion of the last paragraph. Hint: If you're not already familiar with 
the [**Cauchy-Schwarz inequality**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality), you may find it helpful to familiarize yourself with it.

- I explained gradient descent when C is a function of two variables, and when it's a function of more than two variables. What happens when C is a function of 
just one variable? Can you provide a geometric interpretation of what gradient descent is doing in the one-dimensional case?

People have investigated many variations of gradient descent, including variations that more closely mimic a real physical ball. These ball-mimicking variations 
have some advantages, but also have a major disadvantage: it turns out to be necessary to compute second partial derivatives of C, and this can be quite costly. 
To see why it's costly, suppose we want to compute all the second partial derivatives <sup>∂<sup>2</sup>C</sup>&frasl;<sub>∂v<sub>j</sub>∂v<sub>k</sub></sub>. If 
there are a million such vj variables then we'd need to 
compute something like a trillion (i.e., a million squared) second partial derivatives<sup>[*](#fn1)</sup>! That's going to be computationally costly. With that 
said, there are tricks for avoiding this kind of problem, and finding alternatives to gradient descent is an active area of investigation. But in this book we'll 
use gradient descent (and variations) as our main approach to learning in neural networks.

<a name="fn1">*</a> Actually, more like half a trillion, since <sup>∂<sup>2</sup>C</sup>&frasl;<sub>∂v<sub>j</sub> ∂v<sub>k</sub></sub> = <sup>∂<sup>2</sup>C</sup>&frasl;<sub>∂v<sub>k</sub> ∂v<sub>j</sub></sub>. Still, you get the point.

How can we apply gradient descent to learn in a neural network? The idea is to use gradient descent to find the weights w<sub>k</sub> and biases b<sub>l</sub> which minimize the cost 
in Equation [(6)](#6). To see how this works, let's restate the gradient descent update rule, with the weights and biases replacing the variables vj. In other 
words, our "position" now has components wk and bl, and the gradient vector ∇C has corresponding components ∂C/∂wk and ∂C/∂bl. Writing out the gradient descent 
update rule in terms of components, we have

<p align="center">

</p>

By repeatedly applying this update rule we can "roll down the hill", and hopefully find a minimum of the cost function. In other words, this is a rule which can 
be used to learn in a neural network.

There are a number of challenges in applying the gradient descent rule. We'll look into those in depth in later chapters. But for now I just want to mention one 
problem. To understand what the problem is, let's look back at the quadratic cost in Equation [(6)](#6). Notice that this cost function has the form C = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>n</sub> ∑<sub>x</sub>C<sub>x</sub>, 
that is, it's an average over costs C<sub>x</sub> ≡ <sup>∥y(x)−a∥<sup>2</sup></sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> for individual training examples. In practice, to compute the gradient ∇C we need to compute the gradients ∇C<sub>x</sub> separately for each training input, x, and then average them, 
∇C=<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>n</sub>∑<sub>x</sub>∇C<sub>x</sub>. Unfortunately, when the number of training inputs is very large this can take a long 
time, and learning thus occurs slowly.

An idea called stochastic gradient descent can be used to speed up learning. The idea is to estimate the gradient ∇C by computing ∇C<sub>x</sub> for a small 
sample of randomly chosen training inputs. By averaging over this small sample it turns out that we can quickly get a good estimate of the true gradient ∇C, and 
this helps speed up gradient descent, and thus learning.

To make these ideas more precise, stochastic gradient descent works by randomly picking out a small number m of randomly chosen training inputs. We'll label those 
random training inputs X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>,…,X<sub>m</sub>, and refer to them as a *mini-batch*. Provided the sample size m is large enough we expect that the average value of the ∇C<sub>X</sub><sub>j</sub> will be roughly equal to the average over all ∇C<sub>x</sub>, that is,

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://latex2png.com/pngs/47dda0fbc8f77c8e7cc8a32523fe931e.png" width="400"/>
   <b><a name="18">(18)</a></b>
</p>

where the second sum is over the entire set of training data. Swapping sides we get

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://latex2png.com/pngs/ef12d8f9d938b71d5fe77a90673b1926.png" width="400"/>
   <b><a name="19">(19)</a></b>
</p>

confirming that we can estimate the overall gradient by computing gradients just for the randomly chosen mini-batch.

To connect this explicitly to learning in neural networks, suppose w<sub>k</sub> and b<sub>l</sub> denote the weights and biases in our neural network. Then 
stochastic gradient descent works by picking out a randomly chosen mini-batch of training inputs, and training with those,

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://latex2png.com/pngs/3872b797af43e7141b74cbda7a05f1f7.png" width="400"/>

   <b><a name="21">(21)</a></b>
</p>

where the sums are over all the training examples X<sub>j</sub> in the current mini-batch. Then we pick out another randomly chosen mini-batch and train with 
those. And so on, until we've exhausted the training inputs, which is said to complete an *epoch* of training. At that point we start over with a new training 
epoch.

Incidentally, it's worth noting that conventions vary about scaling of the cost function and of mini-batch updates to the weights and biases. In Equation [(6)](#6) we scaled the overall cost function by a factor <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>n</sub>. People sometimes omit the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>n</sub>, summing over the 
costs of individual training examples instead of averaging. This is particularly useful when the total number of training examples isn't known in advance. This 
can occur if more training data is being generated in real time, for instance. And, in a similar way, the mini-batch update rules [(20)](#20) and [(21)](#21) 
sometimes omit the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>m</sub> term out the front of the sums. Conceptually this makes little difference, since it's equivalent to rescaling 
the learning rate η. But when doing detailed comparisons of different work it's worth watching out for.

We can think of stochastic gradient descent as being like political polling: it's much easier to sample a small mini-batch than it is to apply gradient descent to 
the full batch, just as carrying out a poll is easier than running a full election. For example, if we have a training set of size n=60,000, as in MNIST, and 
choose a mini-batch size of (say) m=10, this means we'll get a factor of 6,000 speedup in estimating the gradient! Of course, the estimate won't be perfect - 
there will be statistical fluctuations - but it doesn't need to be perfect: all we really care about is moving in a general direction that will help decrease C, 
and that means we don't need an exact computation of the gradient. In practice, stochastic gradient descent is a commonly used and powerful technique for learning 
in neural networks, and it's the basis for most of the learning techniques we'll develop in this book.

## Exercise

- An extreme version of gradient descent is to use a mini-batch size of just 1. That is, given a training input, x, we update our weights and biases according to 
the rules w<sub>k</sub> → w<sup>′</sup><sub>k</sub> = w<sub>k</sub> - η∂C<sub>x</sub>/∂w<sub>k</sub> and b<sub>l</sub> → b<sup>′</sup><sub>l</sub> = b<sub>l</sub> - η∂C<sub>x</sub>/∂b<sub>l</sub>. Then we choose another training input, and update the weights and biases again. And so on, repeatedly. This procedure is known 
as *online*, *on-line*, or *incremental* learning. In online learning, a neural network learns from just one training input at a time (just as human beings do). 
Name one advantage and one disadvantage of online learning, compared to stochastic gradient descent with a mini-batch size of, say, 20.

Let me conclude this section by discussing a point that sometimes bugs people new to gradient descent. In neural networks the cost C is, of course, a function of 
many variables - all the weights and biases - and so in some sense defines a surface in a very high-dimensional space. Some people get hung up thinking: "Hey, I 
have to be able to visualize all these extra dimensions". And they may start to worry: "I can't think in four dimensions, let alone five (or five million)". Is 
there some special ability they're missing, some ability that "real" supermathematicians have? Of course, the answer is no. Even most professional mathematicians 
can't visualize four dimensions especially well, if at all. The trick they use, instead, is to develop other ways of representing what's going on. That's exactly 
what we did above: we used an algebraic (rather than visual) representation of ΔC to figure out how to move so as to decrease C. People who are good at thinking 
in high dimensions have a mental library containing many different techniques along these lines; our algebraic trick is just one example. Those techniques may not 
have the simplicity we're accustomed to when visualizing three dimensions, but once you build up a library of such techniques, you can get pretty good at thinking 
in high dimensions. I won't go into more detail here, but if you're interested then you may enjoy reading [this discussion](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/25983/intuitive-crutches-for-higher-dimensional-thinking) of some of the techniques professional mathematicians use to think 
in high dimensions. While some of the techniques discussed are quite complex, much of the best content is intuitive and accessible, and could be mastered by
anyone.
