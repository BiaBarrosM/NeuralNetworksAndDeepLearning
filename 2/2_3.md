# The Hadamard product, s⊙t

The backpropagation algorithm is based on common linear algebraic operations - things like vector addition, multiplying a vector by a matrix, and so on. But one of the operations is a little less commonly used. In particular, suppose s and t are two vectors of the same dimension. Then we use $s⊙t$ to denote the elementwise product of the two vectors. Thus the components of $s⊙t$ are just $(s⊙t)j=s_jt_j$. As an example,

This kind of elementwise multiplication is sometimes called the Hadamard product or Schur product. We'll refer to it as the Hadamard product. Good matrix libraries usually provide fast implementations of the Hadamard product, and that comes in handy when implementing backpropagation.
